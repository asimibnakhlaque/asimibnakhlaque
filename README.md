# Hi there, I'm Asim Ansari üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a BCA student with a passion for coding and a keen interest in software development, backend systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills

- **Languages:** C, C++, Java, Python
- **Web Technologies:** HTML5
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring AOP, Podman, Git, GitHub
- **Other Skills:** Exploring Data Wrangling with Python and R, Containerization, and more.

## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **Student Record in C (CLI):**  
  Developed an initial project in C that manages student records through a command-line interface. This project marked the beginning of my programming journey, focusing on basic file handling.
- **Online Quiz in Java (CLI):**  
  Built a command-line quiz application in Java to enhance skills in Java and JDBC, used PostgreSQL for data storage. The project features a structured approach to managing quiz questions, tracking scores, and providing player's feedback.
- **Banking System in C (CLI):**  
  Co-developed a banking system in C as part of a duo project, contributing to the creation of file handling and the main application controller. I have also performed code reviews and enhancements, ensured functionality and code quality.
- **Task Manager in Java (CLI):**  
  Designed a personal task management application in Java that stores tasks in binary files, categorizes tasks as pending or completed, and offers the ability to export completed tasks to a CSV file. This fully functional tool continues to be in active use for personal task management.
- **File Hider in Java and MySQL (CLI):**  
  Created from a YouTube tutorial to gain hands-on experience with project structures, this project introduced me to SQL and various application layers such as DAO, service, database, and model-view layers. I enhanced with custom features like password-based login, BCrypt encryption, and refined email functionality, this project laid the foundation for understanding comprehensive project management.
- **Time Resync for Windows in C:**  
  Developed a C program to synchronize the system time on Windows 10, because the clock battery is dead and I am lazy so to fulfil the need of time sychronization without replacing the battery I did it. The application operates with administrative privileges to ensure effective time synchronization. It needs a manual setup to funtion effectively.
